Welcome to the blog. This is a test post to make sure everything works.

## What this blog is about

Data science, machine learning, statistics, and whatever else catches my attention. Cold hard data, clear insights.

## Code example

```python
import numpy as np

x = np.random.randn(1000)
print(f"Mean: {x.mean():.4f}")
```
